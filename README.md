# Students-Attendance-Management-System
This website was done for mark the student attendance. That time we were selected NSBM university attendance marking system as an existing manual system. That time there used manual system. Therefore, attending marking with signing sheet. Students have to waiting long time, sometimes they are missing their bus, sometimes damage paper etc. So, it was given more trouble. As a solution we were recognized need computerized system.  In that new automated system main process is basically, logging facility to student and lecturer. Lecture time lecturer can log their account and they can generate code for lecture time. After student have to log their account and add the code for marking attendance. That code will expire after five minutes. Also, admin side, admin can view all the attendance tables.  We developed this website using HTML, CSS, PHP, MSQL.
